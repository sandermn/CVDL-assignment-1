# TDT4265 - Visual Computing Fundamentals

This is the repository for the assignments in TDT4265.


## Overview
All assignments are published as PDF's on blackboard, and have the following delivery dates:

1. Assignment 1: Friday October 23rd, 23:59 PM
2. Assignment 2 Friday November 6th ,23:59 PM
3. Assignment 3: Friday November 20th, 23:59 PM

The starting source code for each assignment will be published during the semester.
**Note that**  there might be bugs in the original starter code, therefore, please watch the announcements on blackboard in case we update the starter code.

### Assignment 1
This assignment will give you an introduction to basic image processing with python, filtering in the spatial domain, and a simple introduction to building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch.

### Assignment 2
We will introduce you to classifying images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and how we can use the frequency domain for image filtering.

### Assignment 3
We will explore how we can segment an image into foreground and background by using basic segmentation algorithms, such as thresholding and region growing.
Furthermore, you will use binary morphological operations to manipulate the contents of a binary image.


## Preparing yourself for the assignments
In this course, we expect basic knowledge of python programming and git. To refresh your knowledge, we recommend the following resources:

- [CS231N Python Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
- [Jupyter notebook tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial/)
- [Introduction to git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)

### Setting up your environment
In this course, all assignments are given in python. You can do the assignments on the following resources:

- Your own computer: Follow our [python setup instructions](python_setup_instructions.md) to setup your own environment
- Cybele computers: The environment is already setup for you, check out our [practical information](working_on_cybele_computers.md) on how to work on these computers
- Using our server: The environment is already setup for you here as well. Check out [our server tutorial](cluster_tutorial/cluster_info.md) on how to get started.

### Download the starter code

Clone this repostiory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hukkelas/TDT4265-StarterCode
```

You can also download this repository as a zip file and unzip it on your computer.


**There might be minor typos or minor alterations to the starter code**. If this happens, we will notify you on blackboard and you can update your starter code by doing (In your assignment directory):

```
git pull origin master
```
